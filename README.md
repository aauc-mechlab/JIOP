JIOP
====

Java Inteligent Optimization (JIOP) is a open source machine learning framework wich supports generics and multi-threading on some operations.

Currently supports the following methods:

	- Differential Evolution		(DE)
	- Particle Swarm Optimization	(PSO)
	- Real coded Genetic Algorithm	(GA)

Come back later for documentation of the methods, as the framework is still early in development
