JIOP
====

Java Intelligent Optimization (JIOP) is a open source machine learning framework which supports generics and multi-threading on some operations.

Currently supports the following methods:

	- Differential Evolution		(DE)
	- Particle Swarm Optimization	(PSO)
	- Real coded Genetic Algorithm	(GA)
	- Simulated Annealing			(SA)
	- Artificial Bee Colony			(ABS)

Come back later for documentation of the methods, as the framework is still early in development
